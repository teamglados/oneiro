# Oneiro

Have you ever thought that the cost of using an electric car could be zero? This might seem impossible to achieve;  Electric vehicles are expensive, and for fast charging, you need a special charger. Buying a special charger can feel like an extra financial burden. However, owning a charger is exactly what makes zero costs possible.

Your charger can be utilized when you are not using it. While you’re at work, many others in your neighborhood might want to charge their EVs and use your parking space. This is not just an assumption. Telia’s data (https://heatmap.teamglados.com) reveal that during an ordinary workday many areas where people are staying have no EV chargers. What if you lived there and could rent your charger for them? With an intelligent charger, like Ensto’s Chago, it is possible.

We have created an application that connects EV chargers and EV owners who need their batteries charged. We make owning a charger an opportunity to make money. Renting your station 2-3h per every day could earn you anything between 500€ to 3000€ per year depending on the charger's location.

To see how Oneiro connects EV owners to charger hosts (like Airbnb!), take a look at our demo video (url). Convenient, affordable, win-win-win for everyone.
